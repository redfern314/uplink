It's main purpose is\nto allow for playback of the tracks. The idea is to expose a `Player` object in which the user\ncan load tracks, play them, and get decompressed audio data from it (as provided by the libspotify C library).\n\nWhat the user can do with the audio stream is up to him/her. As it is raw PCM data, it is easy to pipe to\nsome kind of encoder (like gstreamer) in order to broadcast music or stream it to a web user (as long as it complies\nwith the Spotify terms of service ;).\n\nThe user can also choose to play the song locally with a node module like [speaker](http://github.com/TooTallNate/node-speaker)\nor pipe the audio data to another process like [aplay](http://linux.die.net/man/1/aplay).\n\n\nThe main goal is now achieved. Audio data is exposed as the Player object which behaves like a readable stream.\n\nSnippet\n-------\n\nHere is a code snippet of how to play a track from spotify\n\n```js\n\nvar sp = require('../lib/libspotify');\nvar cred = require('../spotify_key/passwd');\nvar spawn = require('child_process').spawn;\n\nvar session = new sp.Session({\n    applicationKey: __dirname + '/../spotify_key/spotify_appkey.key'\n});\nsession.login(cred.login, cred.password);\nsession.once('login', function(err) {\n    if(err) this.emit('error', err);\n\n    var search = new sp.Search('artist:\"rick astley\" track:\"never gonna give you up\"');\n    search.trackCount = 1; // we're only interested in the first result;\n    search.execute();\n    search.once('ready', function() {\n        if(!search.tracks.length) {\n            console.error('there is no track to play :[');\n            session.logout();\n        }\n\n        var track = search.tracks[0];\n        var player = session.getPlayer();\n        player.load(track);\n        player.play();\n\n        // linux\n        var play = spawn('aplay', ['-c', 2, '-f', 'S16_LE', '-r', '44100']);\n        // osx with `brew install sox`\n        var play = spawn('play', ['-r', 44100, '-b', 16, '-L', '-c', 2, '-e', 'signed-integer', '-t', 'raw', '-']);\n\n        player.pipe(play.stdin);\n\n        console.error('playing track. end in %s', track.humanDuration);\n        player.on('data', function(buffer) {\n            // buffer.length\n            // buffer.rate\n            // buffer.channels\n            // 16bit samples\n        });\n        player.once('track-end', function() {\n            console.error('track ended');\n            player.stop();\n            session.close();\n        });\n    });\n});\n\n```\n\n\nTODO\n====\n\n* Bind to the rest of the API...\n\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nThanks to [IainCole](https://github.com/IainCole/node-libspotify) for his help on the playlist subsystem.\nThanks to [LinusU](https://github.com/LinusU) and [swissmanu](https://github.com/swissmanu) for their help on album cover retreivals\n",
